# The-Dungeon-Looter
This is a 3D game written in Java using LWJGL. The game will be eventually be an MMO style multiplayer where you can loot dungeons with friends and fight enemies. The world will be procedurally generated with Simplex noise and I *might* plan to try to release this game to a large platform such as steam in a few years.....
